# Spoony Initiative

## A simple initiative tracker for D&D 5e (and probably other systems)

This is a simple initiative tracker for D&D 5e. It's designed to be used on a computer, tablet or other device at the
table. It's not meant to be a full character sheet replacement, just a way to track initiative and have some basic stats
on hand.

Focus is on D&D 5e, but the basic features should work with any game that uses a similar system for order in combat.

### Planned Features

As of now, we are planning to include the following features:

* Track initiative for multiple groups of creatures (e.g. players, monsters, NPCs)
* Manage creatures (add, edit, remove, auto-roll HP, initiative etc.)
* Load and save encounters
* Apply damage, healing, temporary hit points and other effects to creatures
* GM view and player view
* Load openly available monsters and other data from the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)
